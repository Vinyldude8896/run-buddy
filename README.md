# Run Buddy

### User Story

As a company who focuses on training, we have multiple trainers. I would like a website that will let people know who we are, who are trainers are, and how to contact us. When I am on the homepage, I am presented with a navigation bar where I can navigate to see what we do as a company, what a user needs to do to sign up, our trainers, and a form to contactus.

### Features
